Ein Dungeon Crawler Spiel mit deutschen Untertiteln
===================================================

The source code (*.js) was created by

Patrick Jebramcik
Dietrich Derksen
Florian Kraus
Jessica TÃ¶lke
Stefan Beller

As the source code was developed only within 4 days,
(it was a gift for a collegue, who really is into RPGs)
we decided not to publish the messy git history. So the
cleaned history starts with a single huge commit.

The files in the src/ directory (*.js and *.css files)
are published under 2 clause BSD license.
(Do whatever you want with it, as long as you keep the attribution to
the original authors.)
